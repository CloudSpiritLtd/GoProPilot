# GoProPilot

A cross platform GoPro Manager, for Hero 10 and 11.

Currently, it is for Windows only, and I'm still working on it.

When basic features are stable, I'm going to make it available on other platforms.

2. Pair the camera with computer.
3. Start `GoProPilot`, go to “Setup” page, select your camera and WLAN adapter, and set download folder.
4. Click the connect button in the title bar.
5. Go to “Media List” page and see your photos and videos.
6. Click media file link to download.
